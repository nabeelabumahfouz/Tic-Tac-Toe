# Project Title

Nabeel_Abu-Mahfouz's Object Oriented Two Player TicTacToe Game.

## Description

My project showcases an object oriented approach to tic tac toe in java as part of my assignment 1 project. In this game, there are 2 players who take turns placing tokens (i.e. X & O) on a board with 9 spaces. The board is covered with numbers allocated to the available positions a player can choose. If a player makes an invalid move or entry, they will be prompted to keep entering an input until it is a valid move. A player can win by connecting 3 spaces in a row, column, or diagonal with their respective tokens.
